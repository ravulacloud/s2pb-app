# Enterprise Data Orchestration & Migration Platform on AWS

## Overview

This project implements a cloud-native enterprise data orchestration and migration platform on AWS using:

* Apache Airflow
* Apache Hop
* AWS ECS Fargate
* AWS DMS
* Amazon RDS MySQL
* Terraform
* GitHub Actions
* Amazon EventBridge
* AWS Lambda
* CloudWatch

The platform is designed for hybrid cloud environments where on-premises MySQL databases are migrated and orchestrated in AWS.
